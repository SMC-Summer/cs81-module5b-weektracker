Reflection on My Weekly Activities


1. Were your predictions accurate?

Yes, my predictions were surprisingly accurate. I predicted that "Hiking" would be one of the most enjoyable activities, and it had the highest rating of 10. I also predicted that the "physical" category would dominate my week in terms of hours, which it did at 5 hours total. Finally, the data confirmed my suspicion that enjoyment is higher in the morning (average 9.0) and evening (average 9.0) compared to the afternoon (average 6.0).

2. What surprised you about your week?

What surprised me most was the "Low-effort, high-enjoyment" category. It highlighted that simple, solo activities like "Morning Run" and "Reading a Book" provided a great deal of enjoyment for a relatively small time investment. I often assume that the most memorable parts of the week will be big social events, but the data showed that these quiet, personal moments were highly valuable and efficient sources of happiness.

3. Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

I found the combination of .filter() chained with .reduce() to be the most useful. While .map() was great for cleaning up the final output, the core of the analysis came from first isolating the exact data I needed with .filter() (e.g., only 'physical' activities, only 'evening' activities) and then using .reduce() to aggregate that data into a single, insightful number, like a total or a sum for an average. This pattern felt like a powerful way to ask specific, quantitative questions about my data and get clear answers.
